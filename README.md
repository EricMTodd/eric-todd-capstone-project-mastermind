## Notes:
### CLASS REQUIREMENT
- Three major control structures exist. Input validation, win/lose conditions, and engine feeback.
- Repetitive actions such as user input and input evaluation will be broken down into functions.

1. The program checks if "leaderboard.txt" exists. If it does, the program proceeds. If not, the file is generated with empty data.
2. The player inputs their name to track their score.
3. The program generates a random code to be broken by the player.
4. The player inputs their guess.
5. Checks will be made to verify clean input data. This will prevent runtime errors and penalize the player by making them take longer to break the code.
6. If the data is clean, the input is evaluated.
7. If the win condition is met, the player is scored and the game ends.
8. If the win condition is not met, the lose condition is checked.
9. If the lose condition is met, the player is scored and the game ends.
10. If the lose condition is not met, feedback is provided to player.
11. Return to step 1.

## Tasks:
- Project complete.
